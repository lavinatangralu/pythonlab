36. Program to Find All Numbers in a Range which are Perfect Squares and Whose Number of Digits is Less than 10
Code:
# Program to Find all Numbers in a Range which are Perfect Squares
# and Whose Number of Digits is Less than 10

import math

start = int(input("Enter starting range: "))
end = int(input("Enter ending range: "))

print("Required numbers are:")

for num in range(start, end + 1):
    root = int(math.sqrt(num))
    if root * root == num:
        if len(str(num)) < 10:
            print(num)

Output:
Enter starting range: 20
Enter ending range: 40
Required numbers are:
25
36

37. Program to Generate Random Numbers from 1 to 20 and Append Them to a List
Code:
# Program to Generate Random Numbers from 1 to 20 and Append Them to a List

import random

lst = []
n = int(input("Enter how many random numbers: "))

for i in range(n):
    lst.append(random.randint(1, 20))

print("Random number list:", lst)

Output:
Enter how many random numbers: 5
Random number list: [17, 19, 20, 3, 6]

38. Program to Remove Duplicate Items from a List
Code:
# Program to Remove Duplicate Items from a List

lst = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1, 6]
unique = []

for i in lst:
    if i not in unique:
        unique.append(i)

print("List after removing duplicates:", unique)

Output:
List after removing duplicates: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]
