8. Program to Find the Minimum Number of Desks Needed

# Each desk can seat 2 students

a = int(input("Enter number of students in class A: "))
b = int(input("Enter number of students in class B: "))
c = int(input("Enter number of students in class C: "))

# Calculate desks needed per class
desks_a = (a + 1) // 2
desks_b = (b + 1) // 2
desks_c = (c + 1) // 2

total_desks = desks_a + desks_b + desks_c

print(f"Minimum number of desks needed: {total_desks}")

9. Program to Find the Angle of the Hour Hand

# H hours, M minutes, S seconds since midnight
H = int(input("Enter hours (0–11): "))
M = int(input("Enter minutes (0–59): "))
S = int(input("Enter seconds (0–59): "))

# Each hour = 30 degrees, each minute = 0.5 degrees, each second = 0.5/60 degrees
angle = (H * 30) + (M * 0.5) + (S * (0.5 / 60))

print(f"The hour hand angle is {angle:.2f} degrees")

10. Program to Find the Fourth Vertex of a Rectangle

# Input three vertices of a rectangle (sides parallel to axes)
print("Enter three coordinates (x, y):")
x1, y1 = map(int, input("Enter x1 y1: ").split())
x2, y2 = map(int, input("Enter x2 y2: ").split())
x3, y3 = map(int, input("Enter x3 y3: ").split())

# The fourth vertex will have the x-coordinate and y-coordinate
# that appear only once among the three given points
if x1 == x2:
    x4 = x3
elif x1 == x3:
    x4 = x2
else:
    x4 = x1

if y1 == y2:
    y4 = y3
elif y1 == y3:
    y4 = y2
else:
    y4 = y1

print(f"The fourth vertex is: ({x4}, {y4})")

11. Program to Find the Missing Card Number

# Input N and N−1 remaining card numbers
N = int(input("Enter total number of cards (N): "))

print(f"Enter {N-1} card numbers (separated by spaces):")
cards = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Formula-based approach
total_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2
missing = total_sum - sum(cards)

print(f"The missing card number is: {missing}")
